<p>
  I am Brais, a <span>front-end</span> web developer from Spain.
</p>

<p>
  After some years working as photographer assistant and photo editor on the family business, I
  decided to study the bachelor’s degree in <span>Computer Science</span>, but dropped it a couple
  of years later after discovering that my passion was <span>web development</span> and college was
  too broad of a knowledge base and also pretty outdated, I didn’t like its learning path, but still
  it was useful to gain a pretty good programming base as I touched C, C++, Java and learned about{' '}
  <span>design patterns</span> and databases.
</p>

<p>
  After that I committed myself to learn web development <span>on my own</span>, starting my journey
  with <span>CSS</span>, lately I have been fully focused on <span>Javascript</span> and its
  ecosystem, mostly <span>React</span> and all that surrounds it.
</p>

<p>
  Since then I took a good number of <span>online courses</span>, mainly at Udemy (Advanced CSS and
  Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!, The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real
  Projects! and Modern React with Redux) and some from Wes Bos (CSS Grid, Javascript30 and ES6).
</p>

<p>
  I have also read <span>books</span> like Eloquent Javascript and YDKJS along with listening to dev{' '}
  <span>podcasts</span> like Syntax.fm, React Podcast, Javascript Jabber, JS Party or Full Stack
  Radio and reading <span>blogs</span> like the ones from Kent C. Dodds or Dan Abramov. I like to
  watch conferences from around the world as well.
</p>

<p>
  Everytime I learn something new I build a <span>project</span> in order to consolidate the
  knowledge that I just obtained.
